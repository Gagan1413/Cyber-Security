I’ll be scanning:
1.	My network/router
2.	Website(tutorialspoint.com)
3.	My Vmware Machine
For this, I’ll be performing 3 Scans of each on the basis of IP address, Ports, Services, and OS details.
Commands used:
•	Nmap [ipaddress] for scanning ports 
•	Nmap -F [ipaddress] for faster scanning
•	Nmap -p 1-65535 [ipaddress] for scanning all ports
•	Nmap -open [ipaddress] to show open ports
•	Nmap -sV [ipaddress] to show services of open ports
•	Nmap -O [ipaddress] to show OS 
•	Nmap -O –osscan-guess [ipaddress] to guess OS
•	Nmap -A -T4 [ipaddress] for faster OS and Service detection
