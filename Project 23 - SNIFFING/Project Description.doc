Module 08: Sniffing	


In this Assignment, we have performed two attacks namely, network sniffing and social engineering. Basically, sniffing is a technique through which a person gets access on overall traffic in the network while leaving or entering the network. Here, we are going to sniff the packets and perform MAC flooding, MITM attack, password sniffing and many more. On the other hand, social engineering is one of the best techniques nowadays to attack target by sending phishing emails and fake sites. Today we will be going to detect usernames, passwords, personal details, and other important information with social engineering toolkit, and also perform and detect phishing using Netcraft, PhishTank.

Lab 1: Perform Active Sniffing	
	Task 1: Perform MAC Flooding using macof	
	Task 2: Perform a DHCP Starvation Attack using Yersinia	
	Task 3: Perform ARP Poisoning using Arp spoof	
	Task 4: Perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack using Cain & Abel	
	Task 5: Spoof a MAC Address using TMAC and SMAC	


Lab 2: Perform Network Sniffing using Various Sniffing Tools	
	Task 1: Perform Password Sniffing using Wireshark	
	Task 2: Analyze a Network using the Omnipeek Network Protocol Analyzer	
	Task 3: Analyze a Network using the SteelCentral Packet Analyzer
