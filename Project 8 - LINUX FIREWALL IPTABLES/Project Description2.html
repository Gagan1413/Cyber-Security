Linux lab task 2 – Snort
Pre-lab configuration
1) Make sure you have a working guest Linux box and a host Windows box
2) Check your internet connection, you can either use NAT or bridged mode for this lab
configuration. But bridged mode is preferred.
3) Update your Linux box with root user, use “apt-get update && apt-get upgrade”

Lab
1) Use your group account from now on, you might have to use sudo in most of the cases.
2) Install Snort using “sudo apt-get install snort” ”
3) Start Snort using “sudo service snort start” ” 
4) Run Snort in sniffer mode with “sudo snort -vde” – you see how Snort captures your IP packets?

5) Now stop Snort sniffing with ctrl+c
6) Now run Snort again in sniffer mode but save the output in a text file of your group name “sudo
snort –vde > groupname.txt” (keep it running)
7) Now we will test if Snort captures the login username and password of a non-secure site
8) Go to http://testing-ground.scraping.pro/login
9) Login with ‘admin’ and ‘12345’ as login credentials
10) When you are logged in successfully in that website, stop Snort by ctrl+c
11) Open the text file with Gedit “gedit groupname.txt”
 12) Try to find the user name and password with text search
13) You see? You were able to get the credentials, walah! This is your first hack  it is that easy to
capture login credentials if a website is not secured.
 14) So far we are running Snort in sniffer mode, now we will run Snort in Intrusion Detection Mode
(IDS Mode). 15) Open the texfile called snort.conf with gedit or vi “sudo gedit /etc/snort/snort.conf” 
16) Go to the part where it says, ipvar HOME_NET, change the value from any to your virtual
machine’s subnet. For example if your network is 192.168.20.1 and subnet is 255.255.255.0, put
192.168.20.0/24
17) Remove the # from ipvar EXTERNAL_NET then change ipvar EXTERNAL_NET to !$HOME_NET
18) Save the file and run Snort again “sudo snort -vde” Now we are running in IDS mode
19) Stop Snort by ctrl+c
