Linux lab1  – Using Linux firewall (iptables) to block ssh and ICMP

Pre-lab configuration

1) Make sure you have a working guest Linux box and a host Windows box
2) Check your internet connection, you can either use NAT or bridged mode for pre-lab
configuration. But for the lab part, you should use either bridged or host-only mode in VMWare. NAT mode will not work for testing the iptables rules.
3) Update your Linux box with root user, use “apt-get update && apt-get upgrade” 
4) Download PuTTY – a free SSH client from
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html on your host Windows
computer
5) You need to download and install OpenSSH server at your guest computer (Linux computer), here is the process:
6) Being root, type “apt-get install openssh-server”, it will install the OpenSSH server, then start it
by typing “service ssh start”. Now you have a running ssh server and
you connect to it via PuTTY from your Windows box. You can also check the status of your ssh
server by typing “service ssh status”. To stop, use “service ssh stop” 
7) Now get back to your group user account and install iptables from there. Use “sudo apt-get
install iptables” . Please use your group account from this step and
not root, if you need root privilege you can use sudo in front. Most of the Linux distributions
come with iptables preinstalled, but if you run the previous command, it will upgrade it anyway,
if not then will install it.

Lab
1) Now you no longer need the internet, you can change your VMWare Linux box’s adapter
settings to either bridged or host only mode.
2) In your Linux box, run “sudo ifconfig” and note down your eth0 (or equivalent) IP address for the
machine . In your Windows box, go to Start, run “cmd” in order to
get a command line interface, then type “ipconfig /all” to get your IP address. 
3) Ping your Linux box from Windows box: “ping <ip address>”. Also ping your Windows box from
Linux box (take screenshot – 1 mark). Please note in Windows machine, by default there are 4
ICMP ping requests send and the process will stop after that, whereas in Linux machine, it will
continue to ping until and unless you hit “Ctrl+c” to manually stop it.
4) Now use PuTTY from Window box to connect to your Linux box, make sure you click “SSH” options and the default port 22 to connect in. 
5) Do some browsing in the file system, isn’t it fun to use your Linux box remotely via SSH?
6) Now close the connection, by crossing the window or typing “exit” 
7) Now we will configure the firewall in Linux known as iptables to make sure your Windows box
cannot ping or establish SSH to the Linux box. We will set some firewall rules. 
8) Check the existing list of iptables in your Linux box, use “iptables -L -v” (-L to list and –v to use
verbose mode). 
9) Use “sudo iptables -L | grep policy” to see the policy of the firewall .
10) Now let’s see some new rules. Rule to drop ICMP ping request to come inside sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -j
DROP
Rule to block incoming SSH connection/traffic sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -s
10.10.8.10 -j DROP
Rule to reject ICMP ping request to come inside sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -j
REJECT
Command to flash existing rules sudo iptables –F
Command to save the rules sudo /sbin/iptables-save
Command to see the existing rule list sudo iptables –L
11) Here, -A is to amend or change the firewall rules. –p is to specify the protocol, -j is to specify the
actions, in this case DROP or REJECT, -s is to specify the source IP address (that should be your
Windows machine)
12) Now enter the command to block SSH incoming connections
13) Go back to Windows box, and try with PuTTY, can you login? What error message do you see?
14) Now enter the command to drop ICMP ping request to come inside. Try to ping from Windows
box. 
15) Now try to ping Windows box from the Linux box, what do you see? 

16) Now flash the existing rules 

17) Now enter the command to reject ICMP ping request to come inside . Try to ping from Windows boX
